Convolutional neural network which tells whether an image contains a person or a dog and gives a dog breed classification, even if it's an image of a person! This notebook is the submission for the **Convolutional neural networks** module in **[Udacity's Deep Learning Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree--nd101)**
